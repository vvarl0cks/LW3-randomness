# ðŸ¤« A cautionary tale to never use on-chain randomness

Randomness is a hard problem. Computers run code that is written by programmers, and follows a given sequence of steps. As such, it is extremely hard to design an algorithm that will give you a 'random' number, since that random number must be coming from an algorithm that follows a certain sequence of steps. Now, of course, some functions are better than others.

# ðŸ‘® Preventions
- Don't use blockhash, block.timestamp, or really any sort of on-chain data as sources of randomness
- You can use Chainlink VRF's for true source of randomness âž¡ https://docs.chain.link/docs/chainlink-vrf/
